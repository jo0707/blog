## Improve IoT Development Speed by Switching Arduino IDE to PlatformIO IDE

Yesterday, my team and I were tasked with creating an embedded system project to solve a real-world problem. We came up with the idea to build a system that can **detect early signs of a landslide** and **warn people in nearby areas to evacuate**.

Our system uses **ESP32** as the main microcontroller, **Firebase** for real-time data storage, **Telegram** to send alert notifications, **Next.js** for the web dashboard, and **Python** for backend data logging.

## The Problem

In the early stages of development, we used the Arduino IDE for building the IoT system. It worked well at first, with no major issues.

However, once we added the Firebase library ([mobizt/Firebase ESP32 Client](https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-ESP32?tab=readme-ov-file)) and the Telegram library ([witnessmenow/UniversalTelegramBot](/blogs)) to our ESP32 project, things changed. The compile time in the Arduino IDE shot up to around **2 minutes for every code change**.

That means if we make just 10 small adjustments, we spend **about 20 minutes** just waiting for compilation — without even knowing if the build will succeed.

On top of that, the Arduino IDE doesn’t utilize all CPU cores for compiling. On my machine, which has 12 cores, it only uses 2. That’s frustrating, right? here's the compile steps result:
